## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Service Workers are a form of graceful degradation allowing web apps and websites to function as much as possible in the event of no internet connection. In this lab the service workers allow the recipe cards to still be shown if they were cached earlier giving us more functionality than if the webpage was blank.
